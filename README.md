## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accesibility
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first project using Tailwind. Even though at the beginning it was a slow process, as I advanced in the project I noticed how quickly I picked the syntax for stylying my components. I had some difficulty with background-images and positioning, which made me researched a lot on that topic and learned a lot by doing so.
